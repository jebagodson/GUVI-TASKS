HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure

HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.


HTTP 1.1 (Released in 1997)
Multiplexing:
1. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

Header compression:
1. To speed up web performance, HTTP 1.1 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.

Server push:
1. This service is done only if the client makes request for every content( this is preactical tough in modern websites).


HTTP 2 (Came to use from 2015)
Multiplexing:
1. HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

Header compression:
1. To speed up web performance, HTTP 2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK( that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet. Given the volume of HTTP packets involved in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up quickly, resulting in faster loading.

Server push:
1. Typically, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it. However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request. HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it.
